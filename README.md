There's also a script `deploy.sh` which is intended to install and deploy this configurations to a new debian-based machine.

The script arguments are:
- `--all` - Install the configurations files and packages

- `--user` - Sets the user where the configurations are installed
- `--help` - Invokes the help for the script
